In the first lab, called the [Data Collection API](https://github.com/greeny00/Coursera-IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Data%20Collectin%20API%20-Capstone%20Lab-1.ipynb), it was predicted whether the first stage of Falcon 9 would land successfully. This information is important to other providers. Because if spacex has a high landing success, that means spacex profits more than other providers.  
  
In the second lab, called the [Data Collection with Web Scraping](https://github.com/greeny00/Coursera-IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Data%20Collection%20with%20Web%20Scraping-Capstone%20Lab-2.ipynb), web scraping was used to gather Falcon 9 past launch records from a Wikipedia page titled List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.  
  
In the third lab,called the [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/greeny00/Coursera-IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Data%20Wrangling-Capstone%20Lab-3.ipynb), we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data, such as where the landings succeed and where they fail, and determine what the label will be to train the supervised models.  
  
In the fourth lab, called the [EDA](https://github.com/greeny00/Coursera-IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/EDA-Capstone%20Lab-4.ipynb), data analysis was performed using sql queries in python.  
  
In the fifth laboratory,called the [EDA with Data Visualization](https://github.com/greeny00/Coursera-IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/EDA%20with%20Data%20Visualization-Capstone%20Lab-5.ipynb), as in the previous laboratory, different information obtained by sql queries in Python was visualized.  
  
In the sixth laboratory,called the[Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium](https://github.com/greeny00/Coursera-IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/Interactive%20Visual%20Analytics%20with%20Folium.ipynb), visualization and analysis were performed on the world map using folium. The distribution of the data on the world map was examined.  
  
Space X manufactures the spacecraft it designs reusable, so spacex costs only $62 million while other providers cost rocket production as much as $165 million. In this last lab,called [SpaceX_Machine Learning](https://github.com/greeny00/Coursera-IBM-Data-Science-Capstone/blob/master/SpaceX_Machine%20Learning%20Prediction.ipynb), a machine learning program was created that, with information from previous labs, predicts whether spacex spacecraft will land or not so that another provider can compete against spacex.
